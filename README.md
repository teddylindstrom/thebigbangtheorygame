Features Left to Implement
-Future Ideas

In the future I would like to add a function to end the game after either the player score or computer score reaches ten points, declare an overall winner, then reset the game.
More simple games could be added to give variety to the site eg. Tic Tac Toe, a memory game etc.
A score table could be added so players could log their scores.
